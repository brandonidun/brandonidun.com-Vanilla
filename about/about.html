        <h1>I make a statement by design.</h1>
        <h3>
          I am Brandon Idun-Tawiah and I'm that "COMPUTER GUY". Originally from
          Ghana. I nativerly speak English, twi and a little fluent in french.
          Got the love for computer software. A man eager to learn, understand
          and build more and more everyday. Strong belief in teamwork, hardwork,
          dedication and good communication. I see every task I'm given as an
          impact to be made in this field of work and I'm just getting started.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Developed several skills in this field of work. Some of which i taught
          myself and some i have degrees and certificates for. i like to term
          myself an "Upcoming Full Stack Dev" cause o believe there's more to
          learn everyday. I'm fully skilled at Html, CSS, Javascript(Vanilla,
          Vue, React), Node js.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Aside all these skills, I see my self to be a great team player,
          hardworker ,very innovative and a great leader. I love to be put in
          positions that'll not only call for my technical skills in IT but
          would also require social skills. This is because i believe a team can
          only function properly when these social skills are in play.
